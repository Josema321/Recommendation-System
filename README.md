Our goal is to create an application that takes in the user preferences and geographical location such as taking in the users age, geographical location, to recommend books. With these inputs, this application will output a list of recommended books and it will also output an accuracy so that the user
can see how accurate this recommended book was compared to other peoples ratings. This rating will help users gauge how well these recommendations match general preferences, enhancing user trust in our system.



An integration between Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering that brings a Hybrid Approach for our recommendation technique. Collaborative filtering will be used to identify books preferred by similar users. To implement collaborative filtering, we will analyze user patterns, identifying books liked
by similar users, and to do this we either apply Pearson correlation or cosine similarity to measure the similarity. Meanwhile Content-Based filtering will used to analyze books such as the author, title and year of publication to find books with similar characteristics. We will start of content based filtering by
using the cosine similarity to determine the similarity between the user preferences and check the similarity to the ratings being pulled from the dataset. To summarize collaborative filtering is based on user behaviour and and finding similarities between the users. While content based filtering relies on
the characteristics of the items themselves.
